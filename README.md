# UWM Astro Study Group

The time for our summer study group is Tuesdays from 2-3 pm. We will have weekly meetings starting from June 10th, 2014. I’ll let you know about the place of our meeting in my future emails.  The Basic plan is teams of 2-3 people will present ~1 chapter per week (some chapters may be more/less challenging than others, so this is still a bit TBD).  Each week the presenters will be tasked with providing some original code that incorporates material from their assigned section.  The code will be shared with the group in a github repository, so everyone can play with it during the session. 

## Agenda

* June 10th, 2014: Chris Pankow and Adam Mercer will cover the first two weeks, presenting an introduction to python, plotting and git code management.  We’ll circulate a sign-up sheet for the remaining weeks at our first meeting.

## Prerequisites

While there’s really no prior knowledge required for this study group, there are a few of things we recommend everyone does before we kick this off:
 
1. Locate a copy of the book using one the following options:

    - The book can be purchased from Amazon for <$80: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691151687/ref=pe_355360_113668840_em_1p_0_ti

    - There are three hard copies sitting on my desk. (You can come and pick them up. Since I am not going to be here for the next two weeks, please shoot me an email when you get them.)

    - We have also access to the ebook for $0 through “Safari Access” and “Ebook Library Access”:
    - For "Safari Access”, go to the following link https://ezproxy.lib.uwm.edu/login?url=http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/?uiCode=uwimil&xmlId=9780691151687 then click on “START READING” (NOTE: The UWM library have a subscription allowing 3 simultaneous users in Safari database so that you may run into a message "session unavailable" in case more than 3 people are trying to access Safari at the same time.)

    - For "Ebook Library Access”, go to the following link: http://uw-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?fn=search&ct=search&initialSearch=true&mode=Basic&tab=default_tab&indx=1&dum=true&srt=rank&vid=MIL&frbg=&vl%28freeText0%29=Statistics+Data+Mining+and+Machine+Learning+in+Astronomy&scp.scps=scope%3A%28VOYAGER%29%2Cscope%3A%28UWMINDS%29%2Cscope%3A%28MIL_CDM%29%2Cscope%3A%28MIL_BEPRESS%29%2Cscope%3A%28UWDC%29%2Cprimo_central_multiple_fe Click on the “View Online” option that you can see for this book. When you click that, you'll see two on-line options: “Safari Access” and “Ebook Library Access”. Click on “Ebook Library Access”, you’ll see two options in the left side of the page: “Read Online” and “Download”. (NOTE: The Ebook Library Access platform has also a maximum limit of 3 concurrent users too. It has a "download" option for 1, 2 or 3 days meaning that if someone downloads the book for 3 days the seat won't be available for 3 days -it is similar to checking out a print book out of the library- better using “Read Online" than “Download" so that to release the seat.)

2. Install python and the Astro/ML libraries on your machine:

    - When you install python please make sure that you have installed also the useful packages like SciPy, NumPy, IPython, Matplotlib.

    - Instructions for installing AstroML can be found here: http://www.astroml.org/index.html

3. Familiarize yourself with the basics of Python

    - Appendix A of the textbook has a good introduction.  

    - Alternately, you can take your pick of these other available tutorials:
        * http://www.python.org/
        * http://www.diveintopython.net/
        * http://software-carpentry.org/
        * http://scipy-lectures.github.com/

4. Check your installations and "py-aptitude" by running a few AstroML examples: http://www.astroml.org/examples/datasets/index.html

Please send an email (lalehsad at "mail" prefixed with a "g" and suffixed with a "com") if you have any comments, questions or suggestions.
